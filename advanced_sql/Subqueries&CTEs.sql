/*

Calculate the number of unique skills required by each company. 
Aim to quantify the unique skills required per company and identify which of these 
companies offer the highest average salary for positions necessitating at least one skill. 
For entities without skill-related job postings, list it as a zero skill requirement and 
a null salary. Use CTEs to separately assess the unique skill count and the maximum 
average salary offered by these companies.

ðŸ”Ž Hints:

Use two CTEs.
The first should focus on counting the unique skills required by each company.
The second CTE should aim to find the highest average salary offered by these companies.
Ensure the final output includes companies without skill-related job postings. 
This involves use of LEFT JOINs to maintain companies in the result set even if they 
don't match criteria in the subsequent CTEs.
After creating the CTEs, the main query joins the company dimension table with the results 
of both CTEs.

Explore job postings by listing job id, job titles, company names, and their average 
salary rates, while categorizing these salaries relative to the average in their 
respective countries. 
Include the month of the job posted date. Use CTEs, conditional logic, and date functions, 
to compare individual salaries with national averages.

ðŸ”Ž Hints:

Define a CTE to calculate the average salary for each country. This will serve as a foundational dataset for comparison.
Within the main query, use a CASE WHEN statement to categorize each salary as 'Above Average' or 'Below Average' 
based on its comparison (>) to the country's average salary calculated in the CTE.
To include the month of the job posting, use the EXTRACT function on the job posting date within your SELECT statement.
Join the job postings data (job_postings_fact) with the CTE to compare individual salaries to the average. 
Additionally, join with the company dimension (company_dim) table to get company names linked to each job posting.

Identify companies with the most diverse (unique) job titles. 
Use a CTE to count the number of unique job titles per company, then select companies with the highest diversity in job titles.

ðŸ”Ž Hints:

Use a CTE to count the distinct number of job titles for each company.
After identifying the number of unique job titles per company, join this result with the company_dim table to get the company names.
Order your final results by the number of unique job titles in descending order to highlight the companies with the highest diversity.
Limit your results to the top 10 companies. This limit helps focus on the companies with the most significant diversity in job roles. 
Think about how SQL determines which companies make it into the top 10 when there are ties in the number of unique job titles.

Find companies that offer an average salary above the overall average yearly salary 
of all job postings. Use subqueries to select companies with an average salary higher 
than the overall average salary (which is another subquery).

ðŸ”Ž Hints:

Start by separating the task into two main steps:
calculating the overall average salary
identifying companies with higher averages.
Use a subquery (subquery 1) to find the average yearly salary across all job postings. 
Then join this subquery onto the company_dim table.
Use another a subquery (subquery 2) to establish the overall average salary, which will 
help in filtering in the WHERE clause companies with higher average salaries.
Determine each company's average salary (what you got from the subquery 1) and compare 
it to the overall average you calculated (subquery 2). Focus on companies that greater 
than this average.

Determine the size category ('Small', 'Medium', or 'Large') for each company by 
first identifying the number of job postings they have. 
Use a subquery to calculate the total job postings per company. 
A company is considered 'Small' if it has less than 10 job postings, 'Medium' if 
the number of job postings is between 10 and 50, and 'Large' if it has more than 50 
job postings. Implement a subquery to aggregate job counts per company before 
classifying them based on size.

ðŸ”Ž Hints:

Aggregate job counts per company in the subquery. This involves grouping by company 
and counting job postings.
Use this subquery in the FROM clause of your main query.
In the main query, categorize companies based on the aggregated job counts from the 
subquery with a CASE statement.
The subquery prepares data (counts jobs per company), and the outer query classifies 
companies based on these counts.

Identify the top 5 skills that are most frequently mentioned in job postings. 
Use a subquery to find the skill IDs with the highest counts in the skills_job_dim table 
and then join this result with the skills_dim table to get the skill names.

ðŸ”Ž Hints:

Focus on creating a subquery that identifies and ranks (ORDER BY in descending order) 
the top 5 skill IDs by their frequency (COUNT) of mention in job postings.
Then join this subquery with the skills table (skills_dim) to match IDs to skill names.

Common Table Expressions (CTEs): define a temporary result set that you can reference
    A temporary result set that you can reference within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement
    Defined with WITH at the begining of a query
    Exists only during execution of a query
    A defined query that can be referenced in the main query or other CTEs

WITH january_jobs AS ( --CTE definition starts here
    SELECT * 
    FROM job_posting_fact
    WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM job_posted_date) = 1
) --CTE definition ends here

SELECT *
FROM january_jobs;

Subqueries: a query nested inside a larger query.
   - Can be used in SELECT, FROM, WHERE, or HAVING clauses.
   - Can be used in several places in the main query
   - It's executed first, and the results are passed to the outer query
   - Can be used when you want to perform a calculation before the main query can complete its calculation

SELECT *

FROM (--SubQuery starts here
    SELECT *
    FROM job_posting_fact

Subqueries and CTEs Common Table Expressions are used for organizing and simplifying 
complex queries.
 - Helps break the query down into smaller, more manageable parts
 - Use:
    Subqueries for simpler queries
    CTEs for more complex quesries
